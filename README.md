## Motivation
As a competitive programmer, I always want to participate in every contest I can. But sometimes I forgot and misses the contests.
Some of the platforms send reminders as CF sends reminds before 1 day, HE sends reminders via message.

So I decided to make an app that sends reminder mail uniformly just before an hour or half an hour And also I can change my preferences in between.
